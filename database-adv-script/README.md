# Airbnb Clone – Joins Queries

This script includes:
- An `INNER JOIN` to fetch users and their bookings
- A `LEFT JOIN` to show all properties and associated reviews (including those without reviews)
- A `FULL OUTER JOIN` to combine all users and all bookings regardless of match

These queries are designed to demonstrate foundational join operations for data analysis and reporting.



# Airbnb Clone – Subqueries

This script demonstrates two types of SQL subqueries:

1. **Non-Correlated Subquery**: Selects all properties with an average review rating greater than 4.0.
2. **Correlated Subquery**: Selects all users who have made more than 3 bookings.

These queries are used to extract complex, analytical insights from relational data.
