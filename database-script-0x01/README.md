# Schema Design (DDL)

This script defines the normalized database schema for the Airbnb Clone project. The schema includes five main tables: users, properties, bookings, payments, and reviews.

## Highlights:
- All tables use appropriate data types and primary keys.
- Foreign keys enforce referential integrity between related tables.
- Constraints like `NOT NULL`, `UNIQUE`, and `CHECK` are applied for data validation.
- Indexes are added to improve performance on frequently queried columns.
