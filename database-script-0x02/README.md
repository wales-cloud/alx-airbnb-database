# Seed Data Script

This script adds realistic sample data to the Airbnb Clone database. It includes:

- Multiple users with different accounts
- Properties listed by users
- Bookings with date ranges and statuses
- Payments linked to bookings
- Reviews from users for different properties

The data reflects real-world use cases and can be used for testing queries and validating relationships.
